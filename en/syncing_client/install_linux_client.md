# Install Seafile Client on Linux

You can find supported OS versions on <https://cloud.seatable.io/dtable/external-links/a85d4221e41344c19566/?tid=YzYy&vid=pO5i>

## Debian/Ubuntu

To install the client, first add the signing key:

```
sudo wget https://linux-clients.seafile.com/seafile.asc -O /usr/share/keyrings/seafile-keyring.asc

```

If apt-get reports following error: "The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available", please update the key for seafile repository.

Then add the repo to your apt source list, using the line corresponding to your Debian/Ubuntu version :

For Debian 9
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/seafile-keyring.asc] https://linux-clients.seafile.com/seafile-deb/stretch/ stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/seafile.list"

```

For Debian 10
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/seafile-keyring.asc] https://linux-clients.seafile.com/seafile-deb/buster/ stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/seafile.list"

```

For Debian 11
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/seafile-keyring.asc] https://linux-clients.seafile.com/seafile-deb/bullseye/ stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/seafile.list"

```

For Ubuntu 18.04
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/seafile-keyring.asc] https://linux-clients.seafile.com/seafile-deb/bionic/ stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/seafile.list"

```

For Ubuntu 20.04
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/seafile-keyring.asc] https://linux-clients.seafile.com/seafile-deb/focal/ stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/seafile.list"

```

For Ubuntu 22.04
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/seafile-keyring.asc] https://linux-clients.seafile.com/seafile-deb/jammy/ stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/seafile.list"

```

Update your local apt cache :

```
sudo apt update

```

Now install the client:

```
sudo apt install -y seafile-gui

```

If you only want to install the command-line client, run `sudo apt-get install seafile-cli` instead.

If you want to install the debug symbols (for example, when you want to report a bug), you can install the following packages:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libsearpc-dbg ccnet-dbg libccnet-dbg seafile-daemon-dbg libseafile-dbg seafile-gui-dbg

```

**note:** from seafile version 7.0.8, seaf-cli only support python3.5 or above on Debian/Ubuntu.

## Centos 7

Since 7.0.3 version, we provide official repo for CentOS or RHEL. Currently only CentOS/RHEL 7 is supported.

Add the repo

```
sudo cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/seafile.repo <<EOF
[seafile]
name=seafile
baseurl=https://linux-clients.seafile.com/seafile-rpm/centos7
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
EOF

```

Install Seafile Client

```
sudo yum install -y epel-release

sudo yum install -y seafile --enablerepo=cr

```

## Fedora

**Note:** You can install directly from the official Fedora repository.

```
sudo dnf install -y seafile-client

```

## Arch Linux (Community Maintained)

There is a _community maintained_ Seafile Client package for Arch Linux:

<https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/seafile-client/>

## Linux CLI Usage

Please refer to [this documentation](linux-cli.md) for how to use Linux client on a command line server.
