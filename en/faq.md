### How to pre-config Seafile default account

##### Using Registry (windows only):

- PrimaryKey: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Seafile` ( or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` )
- Key: `PreconfigureServerAddr`
- Type: `REG_SZ`
- Value: `<url to the seafile server address>`

##### Using Seafile Configure file

- Configure File: `%USERPROFILE%/seafile.ini` (windows) or `~/.seafilerc` (others)
- Group: `preconfigure`
- Key: `PreconfigureServerAddr`
- Type: String
- Value: `<url to the seafile server address>`

Beside the `PreconfigureServerAddr` (required), you will need to set up
`PreconfigureUsername` (required), `PreconfigureUserToken` (required)
and `PreconfigureComputerName` (optional) to activate the automatic login which
happens when the seafile client runs first time.

Below is a sample:
```
[preconfigure]
PreconfigureDirectory = ~/
PreconfigureUsername = guest@seafile.de
PreconfigureUserToken = t0Ken
PreconfigureServerAddr = https://cloud.seafile.de
```

Effect: If you have this server address value set before starting seafile,
seafile will pick this configure and put it into the server address list used in
login dialog automatically. This configure can be used with or without the below
configure. In additional, if you have username, access token, server address set
up correctly according to the above note, seafile will trigger an automatic
attempt to login to add the default account.

Supported Client: 4.3.0 or later

### How to pre-config Seafile directory

##### Using Registry (windows only):

- PrimaryKey: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Seafile` ( or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` )
- Key: `PreconfigureServerAddrOnly`
- Type: `REG_SZ`
- Value: `1` (stands for enable) or `0` (stands for disable)

##### Using Seafile Configure file

- Configure File: `%USERPROFILE%/seafile.ini` (windows) or `~/.seafilerc` (others)
- Group: `preconfigure`
- Key: `PreconfigureServerAddrOnly`
- Type: Integer
- Value: `1` (stands for enable) or `0` (stands for disable)

Effect: If you have this value set before starting seafile, seafile will
pick this configure and lock the server address list used in login dialog
allowing only the preconfigured server address set in the above configure.
automatically. This configure can be only used with the above configure.

Supported Client: 4.2.9 or later

##### Using Registry (windows only):

- PrimaryKey: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Seafile` ( or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` )
- Key: `PreconfigureDirectory`
- Type: `REG_SZ`
- Value: `<absolute path to the seafile data folder>`

automatically and start. But if seafile fails to create this data directory,
seafile will refuse to start.

Supported Client: 4.3.0 or later

- Key: `HideConfigurationWizard`
- Type: `REG_SZ`
- Value: `0` (show configuration wizard) or `1` (hide configuration wizard)
